# credit-risk-classification

# 1. An overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model designed to classify loan statuses as either approved (0) or at risk (1). The analysis included preprocessing the data, training the model, and assessing its performance through accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. These evaluations provide insights into whether the model is suitable for deployment in a real-world application for predicting credit risk.

# 2. The results:
Accuracy: 99%
Precision:
Class 0 (approved loans): 100%
Class 1 (risky loans): 84%
Recall:
Class 0: 99%
Class 1: 94%
F1-Score:
Class 0: 100%
Class 1: 89%

# 3. A summary:
The machine learning model achieved excellent overall performance, with an accuracy of 99%. The model is particularly strong at predicting approved loans (Class 0), as evidenced by the perfect precision and F1-score for that class. While the precision for risky loans (Class 1) is slightly lower at 84%, the recall for this class is high at 94%, indicating the model is effective at identifying most risky loans.

# Recommendation:
Based on these results, the model is highly effective and can be recommended for use by the company. Its high accuracy and recall make it suitable for minimizing the risk of missing actual high-risk loans, a critical factor in credit risk classification.
